Structural Geology and Tectonics Studies Group-India (SGTSGI) was constituted in 2009 at Jadavpur University, Kolkata to enhance the level of interaction amongst the researchers of structural geology in India. The first conference of the SGTSGI, named as Rock Deformation and Structures â€“I (RDS -I), held at Jadavpur University in 2010 and received an enthusiastic response from the students, teachers and researchers from various parts of India. It is realized that SGTSGI can provide the proper platform for analyzing and resolving various problems encountered by the geoscientists both by Academia and by the Industries.
