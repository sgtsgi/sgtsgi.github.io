The Structural Geology & Tectonic
Studies Group – India (SGTSGI), which
is a part of the IUGS Commission on
Tectonics & Structural Geology (TecTask),
organizes “Rock Deformation &
Structures” (RDS) series of conference
once every two years. The third conference
in this series (RDS-III) was held at the
Department of Applied Geology,
Dibrugarh University (Assam) from 29-
31 October 2014. The convenors were
Tapos Kumar Goswami and Ranjan
Kumar Sarmah (both from Dibrugarh
University, Assam), and Dilip Kumar
Mukhopadhyay (Department of Earth
Sciences, IIT Roorkee). The conference
was financially supported by Department
of Science and Technology (DST), Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC),
National Hydroelectric Power Corpo-
ration Ltd (NHPC), Numaligarh Refinery
Ltd (NRL), and Ministry of Earth Sciences
(MoES).

The abstract volume of RDS-III
comprised 110 papers, and 130 earth
scientists from all over India involved in
a variety of structural and tectonic studies
attended the conference. 25 oral and 68
poster presentations were made during
the first two days on three themes: (1)
Tectonics of northeast India with a special
emphasis on hydrocarbon exploration, (2)
Kinematic and dynamic analysis of
structures in rocks and (3) Applied aspects
of structural geology: geotechnical
engineering and mineral exploration. The
presentations dealt with a variety of
topics. Amongst others were included (a)
hydrocarbon prospects and its relation to
structural geology (b) earthquakes in NE
India and resulting changes in Coulomb
stress (c) time-relationship between
deformation, vein formation and regional
JOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.85, JAN. 2015
tectonics (d) development of shear zones
(e) microstructures, kinematics, inverted
metamorphism and thrusting in Himalaya
(f) role of muscovite on LPO of quartz
in micaceous quartzites using EBSD data
(g) deep crustal flow patterns and their
manifestation in first-order topography of
Himalayan Mountain Belt (h) importance
of structural geology in tunneling, analysis
of rock slope stability and applied geo-
technical aspects. On the last day, a training
programme (workshop) on “Construction
of balanced cross sections and structural
profiles in deformed terrains” was held in
which 67 scientists participated.

A large number of doctoral students/
young researchers participated in RDS-III.
Discussions after every oral presentation
were long and detailed. The poster sessions
were vibrant, and allowed interaction
between earth scientists using a variety of
methods in their structural geology
research – field, microstructures, numerical
modeling, CSD, EBSD, AMS, experi-
mental (analogue), fractals etc. Thus RDS-
III fulfilled the primary objective of
SGTSGI, which is to provide a forum to
structural geologists within India to meet,
interact and discuss academically. With a
focus on applied aspects of structural
geology during RDS-III, there was also
good involvement from industry side with
17 geoscientists participating from different
companies (Oil India Ltd., ONGC, NHPC,
and Hindustan Zinc Ltd.). It is hoped that
these interactions will provide an
opportunity for greater industry-academia
cooperation.

At the end of RDS-III it was decided
that the next conference in this series
(RDS-IV) will be held in 2016 at the
Department of Geology, Kumaun University, Nainital (Uttarakhand).
