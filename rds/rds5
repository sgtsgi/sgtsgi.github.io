After the First Circular (Conference Announcement) released in April 2018,
this is the Second and Final circular of the 5th Conference and Workshop
on Rock Deformation and Structure (RDS-V) to be held at the University of
Delhi (4th to 6th October 2018). Attached with this circular please find a
Registration Form including Abstract format for the Conference. Please
strictly adhere to the given format. A list of the proposed thematic sessions
is also attached. Please note that this is a national level conference open to
Indian participants only.
In accordance with the spirit of the RDS conferences, poster presentation
is being strongly encouraged. Lesser number of oral presentations will
ensure a longer time span of lively academic discussion and debates over
fundamental scientific issues of Structure and Tectonics which forms the
main focus of SGTSGI.
