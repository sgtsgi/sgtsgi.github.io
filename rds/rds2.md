The second “Rock Deformation &
Structures” (RDS-II) conference was held
at the Centre of Advanced Study in Geology,
University of Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh)
from 1-3 October 2012. It was held under
the aegis of the Structural Geology &
Tectonic Studies Group – India (SGTSGI),
which, is a part of the IUGS Commission
on Tectonics & Structural Geology
(TecTask). The convenors were K.K.
Agarwal and R. Bali (both from University
of Lucknow), A.K. Dubey (Wadia Institute
of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun) and
H.B.Srivastava (BHU, Varanasi). It was
financially supported by Ministry of Earth
Sciences, Department of Science &
Technology, Atomic Minerals Directorate
for Exploration & Research, and Council
of Scientific & Industrial Research, and a
few private companies – Censico Inter-
national (P) Ltd., Encardio-Rite Electronics
Pvt. Ltd. and Leica Micro-systems. A total
of 126 earth scientists from different parts
of India participated in the conference.

RDS-II had four focal themes (1) Fluid
rock interaction and geological deformation,
(2) Shear zones, microstructures and
kinematics, (3) Tectonic modeling of
exhumation processes in the Himalay and
(4) Neotectonics and crustal uplift. A total
of 30 oral presentations were made during
the first two days of the conference. The
presentations dealt with various aspects of
structural geology and deformation
processes. Amongst others, these included
(a) structural control on uranium minerali-
zation in India, (b) recrystallization 
behaviour of polymineralic aggregates in
high strain zones, (c) analysis of tectonic
clasts from mylonites, (d) deformation
style within damage zone of MCT, (e)
microstructures and seismic implications of
pseudotachylytes, (f) kinematic analysis
using magnetic fabric data, (g) deformation
of highly porous sediments by development
of structures such as catalastic slip bands,
(h) problems with approximations in strain
analysis, (i) analogue experiments on
understanding subduction earthquakes
by varying frictional strength of plate
boundary interface in accretionary
wedges, (j) application of critically tapered
wedge model to investigate relationship
between sedimentary basin taper, styles of
deformation and magnitude of internal
deformation in Sub-Himalayan zone,
(k) geometry, balanced cross-sections and
structural implications in parts of MFT
and Lesser Himalayan Fold-Thrust belt,
(l) tectonic versus climate in the MCT
zone, (m) active tectonics in the HFF,
(n) evaluation of tectonics of eastern
Indian ocean from GPS data, (o)
compressed meandering of the frontal
Himalayan rivers due to tectonic activities
of Arunachal Himalaya, and (p) tectonics
of the Ganga Plain Foreland basin. Moving
away from tradition, the researchers were
encouraged to project the image of their
poster and make a 5 minute presentation.
This move was well appreciated by the
participants, and is expected to motivate
young scientists in their future research
activities.

At the end of the second day of RDS-
II, a Group Discussion was held with the
aim to discuss some of the areas of structural
geology research that need attention. Some
of the topics of scientific discussion were
(a) the problems and intricacies of preparing
balanced cross-sections, (b) the problem of
uniformity of lineations in maps of the
Himalaya, when the deformation patterns
observed in the field are quite complex and
(c) importance of geostatistics in structural
geology. It was agreed that under the aegis
of SGTSGI, field workshops must be
conducted to discuss some of the above
issues. Also, it was decided that training
programmes must be conducted for young
researchers and scientists to familiarize them
with various techniques that can be useful
in solving structural geology problems
such as cross section balancing, fabric
quantification, analogue modeling,
numerical modeling etc.

The third day of RDS-II was devoted
to a field trip to Kalpi located on the banks
of the river Yamuna. 70 scientists parti-
cipated in the field trip and it was conducted
by I.B. Singh, K.K. Agarwal, R. Bali and
D.S. Singh. Interesting features such as
linear ridges, cliffs showing anthropogenic
activity and sand dikes were noted, all of
which have implications to understand
the role of tectonics and climate in the
region.


It was decided that the third Rock
Deformation & Structures (RDS-III)
Conference will be held in Dibrugarh
University (Assam) in 2014.
