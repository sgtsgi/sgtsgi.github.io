# Rock Defomation and Structures I 

### Jadavpur University, 2009

The first Rock Deformation and
Structures (RDS-I) conference was held in
Jadavpur University (Kolkata, India) during
29-31 October 2010. The meeting brought
together 107 scientists from different parts
of India who are involved in Structural
Geology research and teaching. It was coconvened
by Professor Sudipta Sengupta
(Jadavpur University, Kolkata), Dr. Santanu
Bose (Calcutta University, Kolkata) and
Dr. Manish A. Mamtani (Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur). The conference
was organized under the aegis of Structural
Geology & Tectonic Studies Group – India
(SGTSGI) and was financially supported by
the Ministry of Earth Sciences (New Delhi),
Department of Science and Technology
(New Delhi), Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (New Delhi) and Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (Dehradun).
The timing of the conference coincided with
the second death anniversary of Professor
S.K. Ghosh (Jadavpur University), who was
one of the most renowned Structural
Geologists from India, and who left us on
30th October 2008. The conference thus
started with an inauguration by the chief
guests (Chancellor and Pro-Vice Chancellor
of Jadavpur University) and a tribute to the
great Professor Ghosh, which was followed
by the thematic sessions.


The conference had four thematic
sessions (a) Field analysis of deformation
structures, (b) Mechanics of fold and thrust
belts, (c) Theoretical and experimental
methods and (d) Shear zone and
deformation mechanisms. A wide range of
concepts and structural geology details of
various terrains of India were covered
through 27 oral and 23 posters. Details of
structures in areas such as Sandmata
complex (Aravalli region, Rajasthan),
Ladakh, Kumaun Himalaya, Sikkim
Himalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Singhbhum
region, Central Indian Tectonic Zone,
Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt, Nellore schist
belt and Cauvery Suture, amongst others,
were presented and discussed. Some
presentations included techniques of strain
analysis, paleostress analysis, vorticity
analysis, fractals, anisotropy of magnetic
susceptibility, balancing of cross sections
in fold-thrust belts and fission track analysis
as applied to tectonics. Implications of
(a) theoretical approach such as NavierStokes
equation in understanding flow
patterns in geological systems, (b) studying
large number of sections to evaluate
vorticity in transpressional shear zones, (c)
SEM-EBSD analysis in deciphering
deformation mechanisms, (d) analogue
modeling to understand phenomena such as
India-Asia collision and evolution of bivergent
wedges, (e) structural geological
investigations of impact craters to
understand gully formation on Mars and
(f) metamorphic regime in controlling
strength of the lower crust during orogeny,
were discussed.


Each oral presentation was of 15
minutes, which was followed by
discussion. The poster sessions were
elaborate, very well attended and led to
one-to-one interaction between various
participants. At the end of each day, there
were open discussions summarizing the
day’s presentations. A “Group Discussion”
was held on the last day to discuss the
future of Structural Geology in India and
how research as well as teaching in this
field can be improved. This was attended
by Shri. Manoranjan Mohanty (ScientistE,
DST, New Delhi) and was part of the
exercise to prepare “Vision Document on
the Future of Structural Geology in India”
that has been initiated by the DST and is
being complied by Professor Nibir Mandal
(Jadavpur University, Kolkata).
It was decided that the RDS series of
conferences to be held once every two
years. The next conference, RDS-II will
be held at Wadia Institute of Himalayan
Geology in 2012.
